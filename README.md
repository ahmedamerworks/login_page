# Basic Login Page

This is supposed to be a basic login page coded with simple HTML and Tailwind CSS (the current JS file is empty).

Later down the line I want to code a functioning signup page with a database for users and a working login button using the JS script found in this github.

There are some basic animations such as hovering of the title and changes in the font color and outline when you hover the nav bar and the sign in button. I hope to update it soon!
